Rank your RAID: Shadow Legends champions by cross-matching the Hellhades's Raid Optimizer and the Ayumilove.net rank

# Installation

1) Clone this repo to a local folder
2) Link your account to Hellhades's Raid Optimizer
3) Go to their [website](https://raidoptimiser.hellhades.com/), open the Javascript Console and copy the token after the `access_token=` in the last message there.
P.S: Remember to remove the last period as that is not part of if!
4) Rename the `config.js.example` file to `config.js`, paste the copied code in between the quotes on `AuthKey` and the minimum stars on Arena (so far the only filter I implemented). If 0, all will be included
5) Run `npm install` to installed the necessary dependencies
6) Run `node main.js`
7) Profit!
